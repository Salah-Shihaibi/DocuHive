A month long placement at ApconiX, an integrated toxicology and ion channels 
company. ApconiX offers expertise in areas including ion channel screening, 
target safety assessments and drug project toxicology. Here I am learning 
about the importance of drug safety in drug development from nonclinical 
safety experts. I have been introduced to the essential role of the hERG ion 
channel in cardiac function and its importance in determining the safety of 
a new drug. I am carrying out routine cell culture and learning how to use 
automated patch clamp technology. I am also working on a project where I will 
be using cell biology techniques to culture and develop a cell line using CHO 
cells that express a TRP ion channel. This will require transfection of the DNA 
into my cell culture resulting in a cell line expressing the TRPV1 ion channel. 
This can then be used to test new drugs against the specific target for potential 
new treatments.

HM Revenue & Customs 
Administrative Officer 
May 2021 - Present (2 years) 
During my time at HMRC my role required me to handle complex customer 
calls and resolving taxpayers’ issues effectively and efficiently. Following 
the perfect call handling shape, I took away the skill of building rapport 
quickly. I have learnt to be adaptable allowing me to multitask and use 
various systems simultaneously to create and maintain customer records 
accurately. Working in a fast paced environment, I’ve taken away the skill of 
professionally communicating via emails and telephony. Due to the hybrid 
working arrangement I was able to work remotely, thus acquiring ability of 
working independently, as well as being part of a team.

was also one of the key concepts of the role. Additionally, I was in charge of
